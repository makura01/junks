  #C->chapter5 % pointer chapter1

  #unix ->chapter1
    > ignore codes just concept only.

not only above list but using #python or #ruby I wanna implements something.
it takes much time to make filename changing proguram.

proguraming c is not something like writing cords.
it's more practical to read.

it's not good to define to-do lists too specific.
my motivation is going down...
