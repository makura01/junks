wake up -> 12:00!!
study from 12:45

why am I doing programming.
because attitude of hacker is very fit with my philosophy.
typing in black console window is very cool I think.

#build webserver
#javascript
#jquery
#cgi scripting

...then I can't imagine what I should do.
creating something is very different from reading the cord.
from now, I'll make in mind that I create from nothing.

#python -> finish dokusyuu python.
#ruby -> create service named vocabulary and pushed it on git-hub.
